# CPU-Scheduling
This repository contains implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms in C++.
The algorithms included are designed to manage the execution of processes in an efficient manner.

## Algorithms Implemented
- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job Next (SJN)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (RR)

## Features
- Efficient scheduling of processes
- Supports preemption and non-preemption
- Handles different priority levels
